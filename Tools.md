# For IDE #

  * **PHP Eclipse**: what I prefer using: http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project.php?id=tools.pdt
  * **TextMate**: Plain text editor, with color styling, and great file management.

# For MySQL #

  * **DBVisualizer**: Very intuitive and robust MySQL editor / client : http://www.dbvis.com/
  * **Navicat**: Very similar to DBVisualizer, but more functionality and cost more: http://www.navicat.com/en/products/navicat_mysql/mysql_overview.html
  * **MySQL Workbench (FREE)**: http://www.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
  * **SQLEditor (MAC ONLY)**: This is a great tool to design your database schema. I use it exclusive. Have not found anything as good.
  * **DBDesigner 4 (Open Source)**: Simple to SQLEditor, but I have not use it yet. http://fabforce.net/dbdesigner4/
  * **DDT 1.5 (Windows Only)**: Another Database design tool, I used it, but no where near the functionality of SQLEditor, but it is FREE: http://gnuwin.epfl.ch/apps/DDT/en/

# For SVN, Subversion #

  * **TortoiseSVN**: Free, and very useful, but it is a windows only tool
  * **SVN Command Line**: for those who do not like GUI interface.

# MISC #

  * **Beyond Compare**. This is a great file comparison tool when used in conjunction of TortoiseSVN. This is great when you have conflicts in the code and need to see the difference. http://www.scootersoftware.com/
